*The following is a debugging scenario in the style of a student-to-TA conversation on Edstem.*

## Student Question
**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**

I'm Using Visual Studio Code in Windows 11, and the terminal is in Git Bash.

**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**

In the "grader-skill-demo2" repository's `TestListExamples.java` code, I modified the test `testMergeRightEnd` to catch the bug, as Skill Demo 2's Step 4 says to do. However, it is still showing 4/4 in the output when it should be showing 3/4. I used the `grade.sh` script and ran `bash grade.sh https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/list-examples-duplicates` to test the file.

**Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.**

Here are the changes I made to the test. To my knowledge, it should produce a wrong answer if there are two items of the same value, but it is still passing and I am unsure why.

## TA Response

Your line of reasoning is on the right track, but you must also consider **why** it is a wrong answer when there are two items of the same value in each list. Think about how the expected array would look like after the merge method runs; why does the current expected array in your test case not catch the bug?

## Student Response

I understand now! In order to catch that bug, the expected array would have to reflect an array that **is** what should be produced, which is `[a, b, c, c, e]`, but my expected array was reflecting the erroneous array of `[a, b, c, e]`. I knew why the logic was wrong, but I wasn't considering how the array would appear visually. The merge is not including the duplicate character when it should be. I attached the command-line output and the changes I made to my code, respectively.

## Reflection

In the second half of this quarter in CSE15L, I learned about what a back-end process like the Grading Server the assignments in the CSE program look like. While I found manipulating our own scripts and java files related to grading and servers to be difficult, I learned about what it takes to debug and troubleshoot the code of others. I could see this being a helpful skill I use in my career for programming or fixing back-end systems.
