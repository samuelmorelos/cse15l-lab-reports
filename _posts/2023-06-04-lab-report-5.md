*The following is a debugging scenario in the style of a student-to-TA conversation on Edstem.*

## Student Question
**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**

I'm Using Visual Studio Code in Windows 11, and the terminal is in Git Bash.

**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**

In the "grader-skill-demo2" repository's `TestListExamples.java` code, I modified the test `testMergeRightEnd` to catch the bug, as Skill Demo 2's Step 4 says to do. However, it is still showing 4/4 in the output when it should be showing 3/4. I used the `grade.sh` script and ran `bash grade.sh https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/list-examples-duplicates` to test the file.

**Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.**

Here are the changes I made to the test. To my knowledge, it should produce a wrong answer if there are two items of the same value, but it is still passing and I am unsure why.

## TA Response

Your line of reasoning is on the right track, but you must also consider **why** it is a wrong answer when there are two items of the same value in each list. Think about how the expected array would look like after the merge method runs; why does the current expected array in your test case not catch the bug?

## Student Response

I understand now! In order to catch that bug, the expected array would have to reflect an array that **is** what should be produced, which is `[a, b, c, c, e]`, but my expected array was reflecting the erroneous array of `[a, b, c, e]`. I knew why the logic was wrong, but I wasn't considering how the array would appear visually. The merge is not including the duplicate character when it should be. I attached the command-line output and the changes I made to my code, respectively.

## Summary

I used the ien6 machine to write and debug this scenario. Here is all the relevant information:

1. The complete directory structure is: `/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/cs15lsp23cu/grader-skill-demo2`.
2. The files we are working with in the above directory are `grade.sh` and `TestListExamples.java`. Their contents in the student's case before fixes are as follows:\
`grade.sh`:
```
CPATH='.:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar'

rm -rf student-submission
rm -rf grading-area

mkdir grading-area

git clone $1 student-submission
echo 'Finished cloning'

if [[ -f student-submission/ListExamples.java ]]
then
  echo 'ListExamples.java found'
else
  echo 'ListExamples.java not found'
  echo 'Score: 0/4'
  exit 1
fi

cp student-submission/ListExamples.java ./grading-area

cp TestListExamples.java grading-area/
cp -r lib grading-area/

cd grading-area

javac -cp $CPATH *.java

java -cp $CPATH org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples > junit-output.txt

# The strategy used here relies on the last few lines of JUnit output, which
# looks like:

# FAILURES!!!
# Tests run: 4,  Failures: 2

# We check for "FAILURES!!!" and then do a bit of parsing of the last line to
# get the count
FAILURES=`grep -c FAILURES!!! junit-output.txt`


if [[ $FAILURES -eq 0 ]]
then
  RESULT_LINE=`grep "OK " junit-output.txt`
  PASSED=${RESULT_LINE:4:1}
  TOTAL=$PASSED
else
  # The ${VAR:N:M} syntax gets a substring of length M starting at index N
  # Note that since this is a precise character count into the "Tests run:..."
  # string, we'd need to update it if, say, we had a double-digit number of
  # tests. But it's nice and simple for the purposes of this script.

  # See, for example:
  # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16484972/how-to-extract-a-substring-in-bash
  # https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion

  RESULT_LINE=`grep "Tests run:" junit-output.txt`
  COUNT=${RESULT_LINE:25:1}
  TOTAL=${RESULT_LINE:11:1}

  PASSED=$(echo "($TOTAL-$COUNT)" | bc)

  echo "JUnit output was:"
  cat junit-output.txt
fi

echo ""
echo "--------------"
echo "| Score: $PASSED/$TOTAL |"
echo "--------------"
echo ""
```
\
`TestListExamples.java`:
```
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.*;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

class IsMoon implements StringChecker {
  public boolean checkString(String s) {
    return s.equalsIgnoreCase("moon");
  }
}

public class TestListExamples {

  @Test(timeout = 500)
  public void testMergeRightEnd() {
    List<String> left = Arrays.asList("a", "c", "e");
    List<String> right = Arrays.asList("b", "c");
    List<String> merged = ListExamples.merge(left, right);
    List<String> expected = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c", "e");
    assertEquals(expected, merged);
  }

  @Test(timeout = 500)
  public void testMergeLeftEnd() {
    List<String> left = Arrays.asList("a", "c", "z");
    List<String> right = Arrays.asList("b", "d");
    List<String> merged = ListExamples.merge(left, right);
    List<String> expected = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c", "d", "z");
    assertEquals(expected, merged);
  }

  @Test(timeout = 500)
  public void testFilterSingle() {
    List<String> input = Arrays.asList("Moon", "MOO", "moo");
    List<String> expect = Arrays.asList("Moon");
    List<String> filtered = ListExamples.filter(input, new IsMoon());
    assertEquals(expect, filtered);
  }

  @Test(timeout = 500)
  public void testFilterMulti() {
    List<String> input = Arrays.asList("Moon", "MOO", "moon", "MOON");
    List<String> expect = Arrays.asList("Moon", "moon", "MOON");
    List<String> filtered = ListExamples.filter(input, new IsMoon());
    assertEquals(expect, filtered);
  }
}
```

## Reflection

In the second half of this quarter in CSE15L, I learned about what a back-end process like the Grading Server for assignments in the CSE program look like. While I found manipulating our own scripts and java files related to grading and servers to be difficult, I learned about what it takes to debug and troubleshoot the code of others. I could see this being a helpful skill I use in my career for programming or fixing back-end systems.
