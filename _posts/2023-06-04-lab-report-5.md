*The following is a debugging scenario in the style of a student-to-TA conversation on Edstem.*

## Student Question
**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**\

I'm Using Visual Studio Code in Windows 11, and the terminal is in Git Bash.\

**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**\

In the grader-skill-demo2 repository's TestListExamples.java code, I modified the test "testMergeRightEnd" to catch the bug, as Skill Demo 2's Step 4 says to do.\
