In this lab report, I will document the keys I pressed to complete each step from Lab 7 and explain my approach.

## Logging in to @ieng6
After opening up a terminal in Bash, I wrote the following to log in:
```
ssh cs15lsp23cu@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
Since we generated SSH keys for our `@ieng6` account in lab, I am not prompted for a password. The terminal logged in successfully.
