In this lab report, I will document the keys I pressed to complete each step from Lab 7 and explain my approach.

## Logging in to @ieng6
After opening up a terminal in Bash, I pressed the following keys to log in:\
*`ssh cs15lsp23cu@ieng6.ucsd.edu <enter>`*\
Since we generated SSH keys for our `@ieng6` account in lab, I am not prompted for a password. The terminal logged in successfully using the `ssh` command, which allows us to connect to a remote host.

## Cloning the Repository From Github
I pressed the following keys to clone the fork of the repository from my Github account:\
*`git clone <ctrl+shift+v> <enter>`*\
*`ls <enter>`*\
After typing these, the terminal successfully created a clone of the repository on a directory called "lab7". The command `git clone` allows us to clone a repository from Github using a link of the repository, so I typed *`Ctrl+Shift+V`* to paste the link from my clipboard. The link was "[https://github.com/yourcousinfrog/lab7](https://github.com/yourcousinfrog/lab7)", which I obtained from my browser by using *`Ctrl+C`* to copy it into my clipboard. To verify that the directory was created, I typed the `ls` command so that the terminal could list out the contents in the home directory of `@ieng6`.

## Running the Failing Test
I pressed the following keys to run the test inside of the Lab 7 repository:\
*`cd lab7 <enter>`*\
*`sh test.sh <enter>`*\
The terminal successfully ran the testing file by using the shell script that contained the compiling and executing commands. I first used `cd` to change the working directory to "lab7" so that the commands inside of the script could find the files without error. I then used the `sh` command to run the script, which is a command used to execute shell scripts.

## Editing the Code
I pressed the following keys to edit the code and fix the bug so that the test will no longer fail:\
*`vim ListExamples.java <enter>`*\
*`<down> <down> <down> <down> <right> <right> i <backspace> 2 <esc> :wq <enter>`*\
I scrolled down the file in the `vim` editor using my scroll wheel and then pushed the proper arrow keys to finish traversing to the erroneous code, which is `index1 += 1;`. This should be `index2 += 1;`, so I entered Insert mode to edit it with *`i`* and then exited the Insert mode with *`esc`* before saving and qutting with `:wq`.

*Editing the Java file using `vim`*

## Running the Successful Test
I pressed the following keys to run the test once more:\
*`<up> <enter>`*\
Since the `sh test.sh` command was up one line in the history, I pressed the up arrow once to access it. The test ran successfully and did not output any failures this time, which means our diagnosis and edit of the bug was correct.

## Committing and Pushing to Github
I pressed the following keys to commit the changes and push them to Github:\
*`git add ListExamples.java <enter>`*\
*`git commit -m "Fixed a bug" <enter>`*\
*`git push origin main <enter>`*\
*`yourcousinfrog <enter> <ctrl+shift+v> <enter>`*\
The first command I used was `git add`, which adds the file to the list of items to commit. `git commit -m` commits these changes and allows me to add a String description, and then `git push origin main` pushes this commit straight to Github. The last set of commands are from the prompt that the terminal outputs, which first requests my Github username ("yourcousingfrog") and then my Github password.

I learned in lab that the command no longer accepts Github account passwords, so I searched online to find the solution. One thread on Stack Overflow offered a solution, which involved creating a personal access token on Github. Here is the link to read it:
[stackoverflow.com/questions/17659206/git-push-results-in-authentication-failed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17659206/git-push-results-in-authentication-failed?page=1&tab=scoredesc#tab-top)
A quick Google search taught me where to find this feature, so I first wento to the Github website and my account settings, then I went to the last category "Developer settings", then "Personal access tokens", and then "Tokens (classic)". Here, I generated a code that could be used to push my commits to Github from my terminal.

I copied the code to my clipboard and then pasted it into the prompt that asked for my password. This worked, and the terminal produced output that suggests the file was successfully pushed.

To double check that the file was successfully pushed, I went to the repository on the Github website and checked the contents of "ListExamples.java". The change was there, which means we have completed all the tasks.
