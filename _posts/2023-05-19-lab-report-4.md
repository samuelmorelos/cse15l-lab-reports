In this lab report, I will document the keys I pressed to complete each step from Lab 7 and explain my approach.

## Logging in to @ieng6
After opening up a terminal in Bash, I pressed the following keys to log in:\
*`ssh cs15lsp23cu@ieng6.ucsd.edu <enter>`*\
Since we generated SSH keys for our `@ieng6` account in lab, I am not prompted for a password. The terminal logged in successfully using the `ssh` command, which allows us to connect to a remote host.

## Cloning the Repository From Github
I pressed the following keys to clone the fork of the repository from my Github account:\
*`git clone <ctrl+shift+v> <enter>`*\
*`ls`*\
After typing these, the terminal successfully created a clone of the repository on a directory called "lab7". The command `git clone` allows us to clone a repository from Github using a link of the repository, so I typed *`Ctrl+Shift+V`* to paste the link from my clipboard. The link was "[https://github.com/yourcousinfrog/lab7](https://github.com/yourcousinfrog/lab7)", which I obtained from my browser by using *`Ctrl+C`* to copy it into my clipboard. To verify that the directory was created, I typed the `ls` command so that the terminal could list out the contents in the home directory of `@ieng6`.

## Running the Failing Test
I pressed the following keys to run the test inside of the Lab 7 repository:\
*`cd lab7`*\
*`sh test.sh`*\
The terminal successfully ran the testing file by using the shell script that contained the compiling and executing commands. I first used `cd` to change the working directory to "lab7" so that the commands inside of the script could find the files without error. I then used the `sh` command to run the script, which is a command used to execute shell scripts.

## Editing the Code
I pressed the following keys to edit the code and fix the bug so that the test will no longer fail:\
*`vim ListExamples.java`*\
*`<down> <down> <down> <down> <right> <right> i <backspace> 2 <esc> :wq`*\
I scrolled down the file in the `vim` editor using my scroll wheel and then pushed the proper arrow keys to finish traversing to the erroneous code, which is `index1 += 1;`. This should be `index2 += 1;`, so I entered Insert mode to edit it and then exited the Insert mode with *`esc`* before saving and qutting with `:wq`.
