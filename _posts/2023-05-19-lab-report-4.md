In this lab report, I will document the keys I pressed to complete each step from Lab 7 and explain my approach.

## Logging in to @ieng6
After opening up a terminal in Bash, I pressed the following keys to log in:\
*`ssh cs15lsp23cu@ieng6.ucsd.edu <enter>`*\
Since we generated SSH keys for our `@ieng6` account in lab, I am not prompted for a password. The terminal logged in successfully using the `ssh` command, which allows us to connect to a remote host.
