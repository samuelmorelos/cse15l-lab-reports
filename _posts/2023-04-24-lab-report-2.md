## Creating a Simple Web Server
In order to write the code for StringServer, I copied the code over from NumberServer and deleted all of the lines involving number incrementing. With this simplified version, I replaced the string of the if statement with `"/add message"` and added another if statement check for `"s"`.

Once these two if statements pass, the webpage should display the text passed.

### The Results

Opening a remote server with localhost allows me to test this web server code. Initially, the URL shows as `http://localhost:4004`. Once I add `add-message?s=` and provide text after the equals sign, loading the page will display the text directly on the webpage. This calls upon the method `handleRequest` and takes in the entire URL as a parameter everytime the webpage loads. A `parameters` String array is created to record the part of the URL after `s=` in order to separate the desired input for display from the rest of the URL. The second index of the array is changed from null to the desired input if one is provided, and the String is then printed along with a new line.

Interestingly, this also works with ints and various other types of characters. From my understanding, this is calling upon the same methods as the previous input, and completing the exact same functions. Since `parameters` is a String array, everything provided is converted to type String preemptively.

## Debugging Code
The following code from ArrayExamples is erroneous, evidenced by the subsequent JUnit test I created. The second JUnit test represents an example of input that runs successfully despite the present bug.
```
// Method that should change the input array to be in reversed order
public class ArrayExamples {
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
}

public class ArrayTests {

// JUnit test with failure-inducing input
  @Test 
  public void testReverseInPlace1() {
    int[] input1 = { 3, 5, 7, 9 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 9, 7, 5, 3 }, input1);
  }

// JUnit test with input that is not failure-inducing
  @Test
  public void testReverseInPlace2() {
    int[] input2 = { 9 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input2);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 9 }, input2);
    }
}
```
Here is what occurs when running the above tests, providing us with a symptom to work with:

As we can see, the first test fails because the expected array does not match the actual array created by the erroneous code. Conversely, the second test passesâ€”no shifting actually takes place:
`arr[0] = arr[1 - 0 - 1] so arr[0] = arr[0]`.

The problem with this method is that it overwrites indexes without saving the integer that was originally there. For instance, running the method with array `{ 3, 5, 7, 9 }` would produce an array `{ 9, 7, 7, 9 }`. The 2nd index should have been integer 5, but it had no way of knowing 5's original position because it was already overwritten by integer 7, so it just copied 7. The same goes for the 3rd index; integer 3 was overwritten by integer 9, so 9 is copied.

So we know what the problem is, but how can we fix it?
There are various implementations that would work, but I will write a temp variable to save the original integer at an index and have it overwrite the corresponding index on the opposite side of the array. Thus, I will divide `arr.length` by 2 in the for loop to stop the loop at the middle. Here's how this looks in comparison:

If my explanation didn't make sense, here's a rundown of how it applies to the first test:
```
We have { 3, 5, 7, 9 }
Loop runs once:
3 should take 9's location, and 9 should take 3's location
Loop runs again:
5 should take 7's location, and 7 should takes 5's location
Now the loop ends, because 4/2 = 2. 
(This is fine, because we've iterated through the entire array already)
Now we have { 9, 7, 5, 3 }
```

## What I've Learned So Far
In Lab 2, I learned how to work with remote servers and remote hosts to supplement my programming capabilities. I had actually always wondered how websites were created without the use of an online website hosting service, so this lab was especially exciting and answered various questions I was never able to answer on my own.

Lab 3 enlightened me to the process of debugging, which in all honesty is not a very enjoyable task. Despite this, I understand its importance in computer science and look forward to developing stronger debugging skills.
