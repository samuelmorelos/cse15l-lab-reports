## Creating a Simple Web Server
In order to write the code for `StringServer`, I copied the code over from `NumberServer` and deleted all of the lines involving number incrementing. With this simplified version, I replaced the string of the if statement with `"/add message"` and added another if statement check for `"s"`.

Once these two if statements pass, the webpage will display the text passed.
