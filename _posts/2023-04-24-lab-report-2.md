## Creating a Simple Web Server
In order to write the code for `StringServer`, I copied the code over from `NumberServer` and deleted all of the lines involving number incrementing. With this simplified version, I replaced the string of the if statement with `"/add message"` and added another if statement check for `"s"`.

Once these two if statements pass, the webpage should display the text passed.

Once I add `add-message?s=` and text after the `=`, loading the page will display the text directly on the webpage. This calls upon all of the code in my program, as
