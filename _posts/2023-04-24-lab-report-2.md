## Creating a Simple Web Server
In order to write the code for StringServer, I copied the code over from NumberServer and deleted all of the lines involving number incrementing. With this simplified version, I replaced the string of the if statement with `"/add message"` and added another if statement check for `"s"`.

Once these two if statements pass, the webpage should display the text passed.

### The Results

Opening a remote server with localhost allows me to test this web server code. Initially, the URL shows as `http://localhost:4004`. Once I add `add-message?s=` and provide text after the equals sign, loading the page will display the text directly on the webpage. This calls upon the method `handleRequest` and takes in the entire URL as a parameter everytime the webpage loads. A `parameters` String array is created to record the part of the URL after `s=` in order to separate the desired input for display from the rest of the URL. The second index of the array is changed from null to the desired input if one is provided, and the String is then printed along with a new line.

Interestingly, this also works with ints and various other types of characters. From my understanding, this is calling upon the same methods as the previous input, and completing the exact same functions. Since `parameters` is a String array, everything provided is converted to type String preemptively.

## What I've Learned So Far
In Lab 2, I learned how to work with remote servers and remote hosts to supplement my programming capabilities. I had actually always wondered how websites were created without the use of an online website hosting service, so this lab was especially exciting and answered various questions I was never able to answer on my own.

Lab 3 enlightened me to the process of debugging, which in all honesty is not a very enjoyable task. Despite this, I understand its importance in computer science and look forward to developing stronger debugging skills.
