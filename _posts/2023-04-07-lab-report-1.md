The following is the set of steps I took to access my course-specific account on `ieng6`.
## Installing VS Code and Setting up Your Environment
### Preparing VS Code
The first step is to make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed. This can be easily done by heading to the [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and downloading it. Go through the setup wizard as usual with new programs and you should land at a screen similar to this one:

### Installing Git
The second step is to install Git, which can be downloaded at the [website](https://gitforwindows.org/). Once the download is complete, open VS Code and open the terminal by pressing Ctrl + ` or accessing View > Terminal on the top-left of the window. Next, press Ctrl + Shift + P or access View > Command Palette and type "Select Default Profile" into the search bar that opens. You should see a couple of options, one of which is Git Bash; select it:

Click on the + icon in the top-right of the terminal window. This will open a new terminal in Git Bash, which you will need to use the 15L account.

## Remotely Connecting to Your 15L Account
### Finding Your Account
You can lookup your account at [this website](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). If you haven't yet, you will have to reset the 15L account's password by clicking on the account and clicking on "Global Password Change Tool" in the yellow window. In this website, click on "Proceed to the Password Change Tool" and follow the procedure from there.

### Using Bash
You can now use Git Bash to remotely connect to the account. Note that if you just changed the password, you may have to wait anywhere from five minutes to an hour to properly connect to the account.

Type `ssh cs15lsp23cu@ieng6.ucsd.edu` into the terminal, but replace `cu` with the characters in your username. The terminal should then prompt you to enter the account password. While typing this, you will not be able to see the characters you type, but your inputs are actually being written. If your attempt was successful, the terminal should print something like this:
