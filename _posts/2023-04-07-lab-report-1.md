The following is a complete set of instructions for future CSE 15L students (and my future self) about what is needed to access the course-specific account on `ieng6`.
## Installing VS Code and Setting up the Environment
### Preparing VS Code
The first step is to make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed. This can be easily done by heading to the [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and downloading it. Go through the setup wizard as usual with new programs and you should land at a screen similar to this one:

### Installing Git
The second step is to install Git, which can be downloaded at the [website](https://gitforwindows.org/). Once the download is complete, open VS Code and open the terminal by pressing `Ctrl + `` or accessing View > Terminal on the top-left of the window. Next, press `Ctrl + Shift + P` or access View > Command Palette and type "Select Default Profile" into the search bar that opens. You should see a couple of options, one of which is Git Bash; select it:

Click on the + icon in the top-right of the terminal window. This will open a new terminal in Git Bash, which you will need to use the 15L account.
